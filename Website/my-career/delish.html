  <div class ="content"> <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->I am currenting interning for a food website named Delish. Owned by Hearst, Delish contains hundreds of recipes and food related news. My role as an intern is to manage their Pinterest account, research and report on trending food news, and go on the occaisional grocery run. My favorite job as their intern is to eat way too much food that is being sent to them for promotion or that was created in the studio kitchen for a recipe. I recently at chicken bacon ranch biscuits and three cups of new Skinny Pop popcorns. <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
