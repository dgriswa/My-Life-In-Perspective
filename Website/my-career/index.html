      <h1>My Career</h1>
      <p>Although I have not begun my career path, I have completed a number of internships that have helped shape my ideals of where I would like to go with my professional life. </p>
      <p>I realized I want to pursue a social justice path when I interned with Per Scholas, however I have amassed a great deal of skills through the additional internship experiences I've been through, ending at my current company, Delish.</p>
      <p>Per Scholas is a nonprofit IT training school where I fell in love with social work. I was able to regularly interact with the students, adults who are either underemployed or unemployed, and hear their stories about where they came from and why they want to change. Learning about the many success stories of people living in poverty who went from making less than $6,000 a year to $50,000 base salaries (usually even more) used to bring tears to my eyes. Working at a company where I was so emotionally invested helped me learn that there are companies out there where you wake up excited to help their mission become a reality.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I also interned at fashion and beauty public relations firms because I thought that was initially where I wanted to go with my career. After interning with Per Scholas, however, I quickly found out that these places were the last places I wantes to be. Combined with the cutthroat-ness of the industry and the lack of purpose I felt when working on assignments, these firms further solidified that I'm at my happiest when I'm helping people succeed, not selling them on some new lipstick or fashion campaign.</p>
      <p>I ended up at Delish through networking via my amazing Per Scholas crew.</p>
